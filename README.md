# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project is a Weather Dashboard. It utilizes Local Storage, and AJAX calls to the Open Weather API to provide the user with current and 5-day forecasts for a particular city. User inputs the city they want to see the weather for, the forecast appears and the city is listed on the past cities searched. Weather forecasts display accurate weather icon and badge color according to the UV index. Current city forecast and list of past cities searched persist upon refresh, as they are stored in Local Storage.
